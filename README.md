These are all my dotfiles used for configuring windows to my liking. I use komorebi and yasb to get a tiling window manager experience similar to dwm. 

Install Koromebi and Yasb, shortcut their configs to the respective files in this folder. - yasb doesn't detect shortcutted config for some reason.

Tip: To avoid yasb from opening a python console in case of shell:startup autostarting the script, rename main.py to main.pyw.

Amethyst is another tiling window manager for windows that looked interesting and seems more automatic (and way easier to setup).

### Software

Some productivity software I use in my windows install:

* <strike> Komorebi + yasb </strike>
* Powertoys
* ZVirtualDesktop
* I am using AltSnap (github fork of AltDrag) as my main window snapping tool as it seems better than using powertoys snap zones as well as the default windows snapping due to being able to alt drag and assign key shortcuts especially for hjkl. The altsnap window resizing is also super amazing especialyl because it works across two windows next to each other like dwm.
    * <strike> I am using powertoys to send keystroke to remap the keybinds from win + left and right to alt+hjkl (capslock would be ideal but powertoys wont bind caps).  </strike>
    * zvirtualdesktop hotkeys are capslock+<number> to switch to desktop, capslock+alt+<number> to move window to desktop.
* <strike> AutoHotKey (required for komorebi) </strike>
* Displayfusion
* <strike>AltDrag</strike> AltSnap
* Battery Percentage Icon (from the ms store)
* <strike> Win11DsiableRoundedCorners </strike>
* StartAllBack
* OneNoteGem - some features i use in onenote
* ChrisTitusTech's Ultimate windows utility
* On my thinkpad: Mouse Speed Switcher (because the max trackpoint sensitivity is too low for some dumbass reason, hopefully they will fix)

* Parsec
