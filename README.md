These are all my dotfiles used for configuring windows to my liking. Using koromebi i am able to get an experience similar to dwm.

Install Koromebi and Yasb, shortcut their configs to the respective files in this folder. - yasb doesn't detect shortcutted config for some reason.

I also use displayfusion for some things.
