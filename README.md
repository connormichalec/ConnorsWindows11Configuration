These are all my dotfiles used for configuring windows to my liking. I use komorebi and yasb to get a tiling window manager experience similar to dwm. 

Install Koromebi and Yasb, shortcut their configs to the respective files in this folder. - yasb doesn't detect shortcutted config for some reason.

Tip: To avoid yasb from opening a python console in case of shell:startup autostarting the script, rename main.py to main.pyw.

Amethyst is another tiling window manager for windows that looked interesting and seems more automatic (and way easier to setup).

### Software

Some productivity software I use in my windows install:

* <strike> Komorebi + yasb </strike>
* <strike> (in place of komorebi I will use zVirtualDesktop just for vanilla virtualdesktop hotkeys) </strike>
* instead of komorebi I am just using zvirtualdesktop and windows 11 snapping as it is less buggy for now. - I am using powertoys to remap the keybinds from win + left and right to the dwm keybinds i like. Not using powertoys fancyzones as I dont like not being able to easily span a window across two zones using keyboard. 
* <strike> AutoHotKey (required for komorebi) </strike>
