These are all my dotfiles used for configuring windows to my liking. I use komorebi and yasb to get a tiling window manager experience similar to dwm. 

Install Koromebi and Yasb, shortcut their configs to the respective files in this folder. - yasb doesn't detect shortcutted config for some reason.

Tip: To avoid yasb from opening a python console in case of shell:startup autostarting the script, rename main.py to main.pyw.

Amethyst is another tiling window manager for windows that looked interesting and seems more automatic (and way easier to setup).
